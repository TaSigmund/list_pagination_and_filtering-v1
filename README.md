# list_pagination_and_filtering-v1
 Techdegree Project 2

 This project adds a pagination filter to the webpage.
 Not more than 10 list items at a time are displayed.
 The appropriate navigation bar is generated dynamically.
 A search feature allows the user to search for a
 particular student. If no student matches the search request
 a 'NO RESULTS FOUND' message appears.

 techniques:
 The display property of elements that are 'not found' gets set
 to 'none'.
 The navigation bar and the search elements are generated using
 unobstrusive javascript.
 Event handlers listen for clicks and keypresses on the nav bar, 
search field and search button.
